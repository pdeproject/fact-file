PDT Overview :
------------
* Payment Data Transfer (PDT) is a secure method to retrieve the details about a PayPal transaction so that you can 
  display them to your customer. It is used in combination with Website Payments Standard, so that after a customer 
  returns to your website after paying on the PayPal site, they can instantly view a confirmation message with the 
  details of the transaction.
